The section on how to setup the widget of the smelter,
has troubled me and have been a pain in my arse,
for a long time (aka, 1 year and 1 month).
I posted it on [Klei forum](https://forums.kleientertainment.com/forums/topic/102473-how-to-use-containerwidgetsetup/?page=0&tab=comments#comment-1156538)
for help and solution but all in vain.
However, thanks to [mentalistpro's help](https://github.com/mentalistpro/Advanced-Smelting),
I'm able to carry on the mission. :D
